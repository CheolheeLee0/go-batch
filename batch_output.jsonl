There are two main types of stock: common stock and preferred stock.\n\n1. **Common Stock**: This type of stock usually entitles the shareholder to vote at shareholder meetings and to receive dividends. Common stockholders are typically entitled to one vote per share to elect board members, who oversee the major decisions made by management. Common shareholders are further down the priority list for ownership structure and are last in line to receive compensation in the event of company liquidation.\n\n2. **Preferred Stock**: This type of stock generally does not offer voting rights, but preferred shareholders receive dividends before common shareholders and have a higher claim on assets in the event of liquidation. Preferred dividends are usually set at a fixed rate and are paid out regularly.\n\nStocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges and are the foundation of many individual investment portfolios. The price of a stock is influenced by a variety of factors, including the company\u2019s performance, investor sentiment, macroeconomic trends, and market conditions. Investing in stocks can offer the opportunity for capital appreciation and dividends, although it also involves risks, including market volatility and the potential for losing the original investment.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "completion_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_50cad350e4"}}, "error": null}
