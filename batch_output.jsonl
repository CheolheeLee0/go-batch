There are generally two types of stock:\n\n1. **Common Stock**: This type of stock usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders' meetings and receive dividends, which are payments made by the company out of its earnings. Common shareholders are the last to be paid out if a company is liquidated.\n\n2. **Preferred Stock**: This type of stock usually does not provide voting rights, but it often offers fixed dividends and has priority over common stock in the event of a liquidation.\n\nOwning stock in a company gives investors the potential to earn returns in two main ways:\n\n- **Dividends**: Payment to shareholders, usually in the form of cash or additional stock.\n- **Capital Gains**: Selling the stock for more than what you initially paid.\n\nStocks are traded on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq, and the prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, as well as the company's financial performance and market conditions.
